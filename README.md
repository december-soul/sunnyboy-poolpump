# sunnyboy-poolpump
a tiny to which reads the actual energy produced from my sunnyboy and switch the pool pump on/off

The idea is to switch the pool pump smarter on and off.
If my inverter from SMA (SunnyBoy) produces a lot of power, then I assume that the sun is shining.

In this case my pool pump should pump the water through my solar tubes to warm it up a bit.

I have connected my pool pump to a WLAN socket which I can control via Tasmota.

It's a quick and dirty solution until I get proper sensors.
